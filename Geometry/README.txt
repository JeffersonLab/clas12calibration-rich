---- Rec Geometry ---

All volumes are from CAD 


-- GEMC Geometry ----

STL Volumes are shrinked of 0.3% using the ShrinkSTL script.
The volumes that are untouched are:
-Planar mirrors (Layers_301) 
- CRFP Panels  and Spherical Mirror Supports
( Pratically all mirrors are untouched but aerogel are shrinked to avoid overlaps )
